## Purpose

This document set defines architecture standards for software projects. It is prescriptive, not advisory. These are decisions, not options.

When a technology choice no longer serves the standard, the standard is updated. Individual projects do not deviate; the standard evolves.

---

## Context

Architectural decisions made inconsistently across projects create compounding costs — different teams reinvent the same solutions, onboarding takes longer, and AI code assistants produce inconsistent output without shared conventions. This document set exists to make those decisions once, document them prescriptively, and apply them uniformly.

The structure separates Core standards (which apply to every project unconditionally) from Optional modules (which are adopted per project need). This lets teams skip irrelevant complexity — a backend-only API doesn't need frontend standards — while ensuring that when a capability is adopted, it follows the same patterns everywhere. Optional modules declare their dependencies explicitly, so adopting one module tells you exactly what else you need.

Each document in this set is self-contained enough to be read independently, but they form a coherent whole. Core Principles (01) define the non-negotiable mandates. Backend Architecture (03) and Module Structure (04) define how code is organized. Concurrency and Resilience (24) defines the concurrency model, parallelism patterns, and resilience standards (circuit breakers, retries, timeouts) that apply to all external calls. Coding Standards (10, 11), Testing (16), and Workflow (13) define how code is written and shipped. Security (17), Data Protection (18), and Authentication (09) define how it is secured. Observability (12) defines the three pillars: logs, metrics, and distributed traces. Deployment (21, 22) defines how it runs. Optional modules — Data Layer (05), Events (06), Frontend (07), LLM (08), Telegram (20, 23), Agentic AI (25, 26), Agent-First Infrastructure (27), TUI (28), Multi-Channel Gateway (29) — extend the core when projects need those capabilities.

### Optional Scope (via modules)

- AI/LLM integration
- Agentic AI systems (autonomous agents, orchestration, tools, memory)
- Agent-first infrastructure (MCP, A2A, agent identity, intent APIs)
- Multi-channel delivery (Telegram, Slack, Discord, WebSocket gateway)
- Real-time data streaming
- Time-series data processing
- Event-driven architectures

---

## Core Philosophy

### Backend-First Architecture

All business logic resides in the backend. Clients are presentation layers only. No business rules, validation logic, or data transformation occurs in clients.

Benefits:
- Single source of truth
- Consistent behavior across all client types
- Security logic centralized
- Easier testing and debugging
- New clients require only API consumption

### Thin Client Mandate

Clients perform three functions only:
1. Present data received from the backend
2. Capture user input and send to backend
3. Handle client-specific UI/UX concerns

Clients never:
- Validate business rules
- Transform data for storage
- Make decisions about application state
- Store business data locally (caching excepted)

### Simplicity Over Cleverness

Prefer boring, proven solutions over novel approaches. Code should be readable by developers unfamiliar with the codebase. Abstractions are introduced only when duplication becomes problematic.

### AI-Assisted Development

Architecture choices favor technologies with extensive AI training data. This maximizes effectiveness of AI coding assistants and reduces development friction.

**Cross-cutting core documents** (referenced by most optional modules):

| Core Document | Referenced By |
|---------------|---------------|
| 24-concurrency-and-resilience.md | 03, 06, 08, 12, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26 |
| 12-observability.md | 03, 06, 08, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 29 |

Doc 24 defines the shared resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, bulkhead, timeout) and concurrency model (asyncio, thread pools, process pools) that all service-layer and consumer code uses. Doc 12 defines the three-pillar observability standard (logs, metrics, traces) that all components emit into.

If adopting 07-frontend-architecture.md, also adopt 11-typescript-coding-standards.md.
If adopting 26-agentic-pydanticai.md, also adopt 25-agentic-architecture.md, 08-llm-integration.md, and 06-event-architecture.md.
If adopting 27-agent-first-infrastructure.md, ensure 03-backend-architecture.md and 09-authentication.md are in place (both are core, so always present). Doc 27 is independent of 25/26 but composes naturally with them.
If adopting 29-multi-channel-gateway.md, ensure 03-backend-architecture.md and 20-telegram-bot-integration.md are in place. Doc 29 benefits from 25/26 for agent routing but can operate with any backend handler.

---

## When To Update This Standard

Update the standard when:
- A technology becomes unmaintained or deprecated
- Significantly better alternatives emerge with production maturity
- Security vulnerabilities require technology replacement
- Scale requirements exceed current technology capabilities

Do not update for:
- Personal preference
- Novelty or trendiness
- Minor performance improvements
- Single project edge cases

---

## Compliance

All new projects must follow Core standards. Optional modules are adopted per project needs.

Existing projects should migrate toward compliance during major refactoring efforts.

Deviations require documented justification and approval. Approved deviations are tracked for potential standard updates.

---

## Quick Start

For a new project:

1. Apply all Core standards (including 24-concurrency-and-resilience.md for resilience patterns)
2. Review Optional modules against project requirements
3. Document which Optional modules are adopted in project README
4. Follow the primitive identification process (02-primitive-identification.md)
5. Set up project structure per 03-backend-architecture.md
